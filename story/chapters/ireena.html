<p>After welcoming us in, we began to take measure of Ireena. She didn’t appear to be sick at all, in fact she looked healthier than anyone we had seen in the village. She was vibrant and beautiful and while she didn’t quite stand as a warrior would, you could tell the weapons at her side didn’t make her uncomfortable. This made Arrigal’s story seem less plausible. I inspected her myself and she seemed perfectly fine and healthy.</p>

<p>What’s more, she reiterated Ismark’s position on Strahd and the danger he posed having come into contact with him herself. She described him as devastatingly handsome and terrifying at the same time, recalling very little of their meeting other than a few key details: he told her to come back to him and called her Tatiana. It didn’t really make sense to me or, apparently, to Ireena who said she had no dealings with Strahd and that the burgomeister was her father. I asked if she possessed magic, given her overall good health and she said she did not, but sometimes magic can live beneath the surface and work on one’s behalf, at least in my experience, so I will keep an eye on her.</p>

<p>After speaking with us a while, Ismark told us he had one rule for the home and requested a favor. The burgomeister had passed just before our arrival and they asked we not go into the room in which he is resting and requested we take him to Church of Lathander tomorrow to give him his final rites and bury him. Something he and Ireena cannot do alone. As a cleric of Lathander helping put a follower of the Morning Lord to rest was paramount and I of course agreed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, it had gotten quite late and as it was approaching midnight Ismark brought us upstairs to one of the few intact windows and said simply “You asked why we haven’t killed him? Here is what Strahd does to those who try and strike him down.” An eerie green glow seemed to emanate from the village and the surrounding area I could see as corpses rose wearing adventurers garb and started a solitary march to the castle. I can only assume they are brought back to fight Strahd and suffer defeat over and over again in a grim parade that doesn’t allow them true rest. His grip on this land seems ironclad and I am beginning to worry nothing will loosen his grasp.</p>

<p>Peeling our eyes away from the spectacle Strahd created, we decided to rest and took turns on watch. First up was Gadwick and Ireena. My room was right below theirs and I caught snippets of their conversation prior to falling asleep. Or perhaps I was dreaming this interaction? Gadwick suggested that he had a shrine to Fiona, his late wife, in his home and spoke of caressing her bones. I thought Father Elmsworth had done her last rites and buried her properly? I’ll have to investigate this after we get back to Eldemere. I was definitely awake after hearing an explosion on the grounds and Ireena’s incredulous yelling of “You did that to a bat?!”. I don’t recall much after that, but I do remember having a slight twinge of jealousy that Rick got to keep watch with Ismark.</p>

<p>I was on the third watch with Hoberm, but that suited both of us well. Hoberm likes to be left alone and took to looking for exotic plants around the grounds and found some edible berries for us. I used the time to exercise and write in my journal.</p>

<p>After a largely uneventful night, we woke to the solemn duty of carrying the burgomeister to his final place of rest at the Church of the Morning Lord where Father Donovich, who I was eagerly awaiting to speak to, would read his rites. Upon arrival, something appeared amiss, we heard screams and after entering the church found Father Donovich with his head down chanting, praying, begging perhaps for some sign from Lathander. At first he didn’t want to tell us what was happening or why there was screaming, but when he finally got control over himself and steadied, he saw the armor Rick and I wore. The emblem of Lathander across our chests and began crying, but this time overjoyed.</p>

<p>He began to tell us the tale of his son, Doru, who had become sick one day out of the blue about three weeks ago. He wouldn’t eat, he wouldn’t drink, but complained constantly of hunger. Not knowing what to do, Donovich placed Doru in the cellar. With all the discussion of vampires, I knew it was a possibility we would run into this eventually, but so soon? And to a young man, tragic, but it did sound as Ismark emphatically said “he’s a vampire”. Donovich, perhaps blinded by grief, refused to believe his son could have been turned. We implored him to allow us to investigate and speak to his son, but Donovich insisted he be the one to talk to him first. Our party reluctantly agreed, but shielded him with magic to guard him against Doru.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, things took a turn for the worse as Doru struck out against his father and we raced into the cellar where he was being kept. We battled tirelessly, Ismark moved quite gracefully, slashing at Doru first, but only grazing him. He hadn’t eaten in three weeks, but was lithe, strong, and fast. As he bounded around us I caught him once with my sword as Gadwick pummeled him with magic.</p>

<p>Father Donovich begged us to stop, but seeing the immediate danger Hoberm restrained him with tangling vines and Ismark held him back. Rick summoned the light of Lathander and brought it crashing down in a golden wave to push Doru back. Not ready to give up, Doru swiped at Hoberm who vanished in a cloud of mist and appeared further back in the cellar out of harm’s way. Doru, perhaps realizing he was outmatched, tried to run, but we caught him just outside the cellar. Rick, with some sadness in his eyes slashed his blade one last time at Doru who crumpled and turned to ash before us.</p>
