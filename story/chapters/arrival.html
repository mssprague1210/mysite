<p>It was a pleasant ride out of the kingdom. I will miss the lush green hills of Eldemere and my normal routine. I don't think it will be easy. If ordinary healers could help this girl, they would have by now. No, she will require divinity. Lathander and His light can purify anything, but the power to channel His divinity at that level currently eludes me. A shame that Head Cleric Elmsworth is no longer among us. He taught me so much, but I fear I might not be able to help the poor girl, and I won't have the ability to change her fate. Perhaps the journey will strengthen me enough to help her. I have to continue to train my body and my mind.</p>

<p>As we entered Barovia the fog set upon us. At first a minor annoyance, it progressed rapidly into something that felt alive. Seemingly wrapping and twisting around my arm as I reached for my sword. Finally, there was no continuing, as the sun was totally blotted out and the fog so thick. Maybe it will break in the morning? For now we'll camp.</p>

<p>Later, before the wolves struck, Rick noted that he found a corpse with a letter that directly contradicted Arrigal's message of riches from the burgomeister. In fact, it advised that no one ever enter Barovia and that it should be warded with powerful magicks so no one can.</p>

<p>The wolves set upon us quickly, cornering us and brutally attacking Gadwick. I managed to revive him, and Rick felled one, but were it not for Arrigal's intervention I fear we might have been lost. Gadwick nearly died though, and a spell I used misfired. The darkness here, like the fog, is almost palpable, but Lathander whispered to me to be strong, and more magic than I expected channeled into Gadwick, raising him, and he shot awake thankfully. When Arrigal pointed us in the direction to flee, we came across a town almost immediately. Odd that he wouldn't have told us to go there to rest. For some reason, I can't shake the feeling that we were being forced into the ragged town. A grim start to our journey, but I tried to give the team a pep talk — we'll see if it takes.</p>

<p>The bar was dimly lit and frankly depressing. The people looked weary and maybe a bit sad. A lone man, sleeping at the bar, strikingly handsome, but wearing clothes that seemed worse for the wear. Ismark was his name. He even offered to buy us food, and Gadwick stoically ate the worst-smelling cheese in existence while the rest of us had jerky that might be mistaken for glass.</p>

<p>As for the others in the bar? They were reticent to speak to us, but not Ismark. I don't often go to bars, but maybe I should. I noticed a small token of Lathander, a charm hanging from his belt, but he spoke a lot of missing the light, and it hurt me to see the tiny spark in his eyes only desperately clinging to faith. I attempted to cheer him up, buoy his spirits, and honestly, I'm hopeful he remembers me.</p>

<p>That said, what he told us was disturbing and I am a bit wary. Ismark seems trustworthy, but I couldn't sense any lies or deceipt in Arrigal. Or is that wishful thinking? Was my desire to restore Eldemere blinding me to the truth? Without Arrigal and given the earnest desperation in the way Ismark speaks to us, I have little reason to doubt him for now. We showed him the letter Rick found on the corpse and Ismark verified that it was his father's (who happens to be the burgomeister) writing. He called Arrigal's story untrue and warned the Vistani would lie at any opportunity, saying they were servants of Strahd, a vampire that lives in the large looming castle that overlooks this village. He told us that simply leaving is not possible — we have been pulled into Strahd's "game," apparently. Arrigal was nice to us, so I am a little skeptical of this, but Ismark promised to introduce us to Ireena. Perhaps seeing the girl will help us decide the best course of action.</p>
