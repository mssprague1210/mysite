<p><em>Ahem, it is I, Gadwick and I would like to make a correction to the previous entry. My powerful magics are what delivered the final blow to the dear departed Doru. It was with thoughts of sending him to see my sweet Fiona that I sent him to the afterlife. Do not fault Ket, for he was downstairs when my great power was on display and assumed it was the hand of our paladin Rick.</em></p>

<p>Sorry for the interruption, but Gadwick did insist it be right even if I “captured the spirit” of the events. What I do remember clearly is Gadwick suggesting that Father Donovich wouldn’t be able to take the death of his son Doru and that we should tell him he escaped our clutches and ran. This struck a chord with me; Gadwick and I nearly came to blows. I will admit, his ability to convince people is uncanny, and before I could voice my objection to this, Ismark was fetching a broom to hide the boy’s ashes. Am I wrong, reader? To refuse to lie to a man of the church who has lost a son? For what? False hope? And to tarnish our own honor to give it to him.</p>

<p>I told Father Donovich myself, refusing to be convinced by Gadwick. He was deeply saddened, but not inconsolable. I think some part of his heart knew what his son had become and took solace in his release from being an abomination to the Light. We paid tribute to him and in lieu of burying anything to do with the vampire he became, we instead buried the bells he rang and treasured so much.</p>

<p>My heart breaks for Father Donovich. I knew Strahd was evil and twisted, but to see his horrid actions play out before us is something different. I cannot save Doru’s life, but I can make sure his soul reaches Lathander. And so that is what I pledge to fight for throughout this journey, Doru and souls like him, unfortunate and perhaps unlucky, I will guide them to the light.</p>

<p>With Doru taken care of, we set out to bury the burgomeister, the task we had originally planned to do this morning. It was not quite as elegant as a burial at home would have been, but given the circumstances, it was quite nice. We faced east to symbolize the rising of a new dawn with the passing of his spirit and Hoberm put on a lovely display of a spectral deer, much like the one on Ismark’s family crest. I am hopeful this gives both Ismark and Ireena some closure, and I believe it did. Ismark was ready to move on and suggested we get provisions for our journey to the next town.</p>

<p>We made our way to the only merchant in town, he was known as Bildrath, and seemed to be quite a nasty fellow. The first thing he told us is that everything is 100 gold. Which in any normal town would be laughable, the baker would gladly sell you everything he makes in a day for such a hefty sum, but I suppose it’s about right for a place with no bakers and one merchant. It did price us out of well…everything, unfortunately. He did make us one offer: steal from Sorvia, the Vistani in the bar (whose privates Gadwick called “crusty” if you recall) a book in her possession and he’d help us out.</p>

<p>Ismark was very clear that there would be no stealing in his presence, and I have to agree. “Crusty” or not, Sorvia did not deserve to have something she cared for plundered for our benefit. We didn't expressly need anything from this man, so we began to make our way back where we met Ireena on the road. We told her of Bildrath’s proposal and she chuckled, “Oh, he wants her poetry, Sorvia told me he has grand dreams of becoming a poet.”</p>

<p>To which Ismark responded that it must have something to do with a prophecy he received from Madam Eva. She is apparently the oldest of the Vistani and has a mysterious power to plot out the destiny of those who come see her. She is a mystic and a Vistani that even Ismark begrudgingly respects. We didn’t speak a whole lot about her, but Ismark did mention we should see her to divine more about Ireena and why Strahd seems so obsessed with her.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don’t think stealing is right, but what was proposed next is we don’t steal from Sorvia, but rather creatively impersonate her and try to pass off our poems as hers.</p>

<p>I am not opposed to this because Bildrath, well, Bildrath is a piece of shit really. He’s taking advantage of people with hardly anything, asking people to steal and certainly looting corpses. I don’t have a problem tricking a man like that, so we set out to write some poems. I have to start mine and you’ll find it here in this journal.</p>
