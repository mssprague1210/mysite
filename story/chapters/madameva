<p><em>Fog creeps across the land,


Darkness tightening its hand.


Shrouding all in lifeless blight,


Blotting out all hope of light.


The foul creatures take their turn,


For in the dawn their flesh would burn.


An empire where hope is extinguished,


A grip the darkness has not relinquished.


A people whose souls are held, imprisoned,


A group of heroes a seer envisioned.


An outcome she has told to none,


The main event has just begun.</em></p>

<p>As promised, the poem I wrote to try and convince Bildrath we had stolen from Sorvia. Ismark seemed to like it, though he called it a bit dark for a Vistani poem. I can’t seem to fully rid the darkness from myself though to see the good of this place. Perhaps Ismark is right, they can’t be trusted. Not for some sinister reason, but rather that they can find joy in this place.</p>

<p>We compiled what we had written to Bildrath and after some negotiation and some convincing, he seemed to buy that they were genuine. Though he said, “perhaps some of her early work” which stung a bit, I thought mine was quite good. He revealed his own fortune from Madam Eva:</p>

<p>She had told Bildrath he is selfish, and that the only way he would ever find peace is to remove that from his soul. He told her that's not possible, claiming, “I'm a very giving man who provides for his nephew and the people of the town.” Eva laughed, he said, and her eyes flashed as she picked up a card from the deck and said, “if you bestow this on someone else, then maybe your selfish streak will end.” Shocking all of us, his “stockpile” and “best wares” was just the card, which he gave in exchange for some mediocre poetry.</p>

<p>As he gave us the card for the poems, something about the air around us shifted. Bildrath paused momentarily and stumbled on his words; he was a bit confused and then something even more shocking happened, his entire demeanor changed. He sold us whatever we wanted at a fair price, not seeming to mind that he had his captive market anymore. The greed in him seemed to melt away, as though Eva had unlocked something in him. This is clearly why Ismark is so hell-bent on us going to her and having our fortunes read.</p>

<p>With his change of demeanor and our packs filled with rations and the things we needed for a long journey, we decided to head out. We moved swiftly to Eva’s camp which wasn’t too far from us, but right before we got there something disturbing happened. We saw a man hanging from a gallows, alone, and I looked but could see only myself. A voice I didn’t recognize filled my head: "there's no light in my land, cleric". It wasn’t filled with mirth or hatred, just simply stating a fact. I have a feeling it will haunt me for some time. Did the others encounter this?</p>

<p>Still shaken by what I had seen, we made our way to Eva’s camp where I sat quietly, listening to the others speak to the Vistani. Finally, when we told them our purpose they scoffed as though it was far beneath her to see the likes of us, but she called us into her tent. “At last, you have arrived,” she said as though expecting us.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no reason to speak to Madam Eva; she had clearly been watching us and looked each one of us in the eye and told us a stark reality.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rick</strong> - she warns the blade of legacy weighs heavily upon him.</li>
<li><strong>Gadwick</strong> - she sounds ostensibly sad for Fiona’s loss and mentions that someone may offer to bring her back.</li>
<li><strong>Tatiana (Ireena)</strong> - she tells us Strahd has claimed her, and that her fate is in our hands.</li>
<li><strong>Hoberm</strong> - she acknowledges the twisted nature of this place.</li>
<li><strong>Ismark</strong> - she scoffs and calls him a mutt.</li>
<li>And finally, <strong>myself</strong>, she warns that light can be snuffed out.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Without asking us our thoughts or inviting discourse, she delved quickly into our readings. Shuffling her cards, drawing one for each of us and looking us in the eyes as she read the fortune she drew:</p>

<p><strong>Rick</strong><br>
For you honorable knight have drawn the Avenger. The card beheld to you tells of a blade of sunlight resting among dead knights in the house of a dragon, who burn with hatred even in death. A weapon once wielded by Strahd's own kin.</p>

<p><strong>Gadwick</strong><br>
For you Gadwick the Burnt have drawn the Necromancer. This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness. “A broken wizard hides among the highest peak, his mind shattered but his power unquenched. Tempted by forces unimaginable.”</p>

<p><strong>Ireena</strong><br>
For you dear child have drawn the Darklord. When the final battle comes, the Devil waits at the place where his love was lost to the abyss.</p>

<p><strong>Hoberm</strong><br>
For you halfling have drawn the Raven. This card speaks of a diary of the ancient wizard who brought the land under his sway. This book tells of ancient evil. It is the key to understanding the Devil, to undoing his power. Look for the mother in the ruins of a tragedy. She who gave birth to evil. She who prizes his rise to darkness.</p>

<p><strong>Ket</strong><br>
For you cleric of Lathander have drawn the Missionary. The card beholds to you a beacon of protection against the forces of darkness. This symbol of hope lies in a place of healing, a place of sickness and madness with one who has lost the light he once fiercely protected.</p>

<p><em>What does this all mean?</em></p>
