<p>The story begins as our heroes of Eldemere wake to a summons from the Duchess, calling them to the main hall. This was unusual. After all, the hall had fallen into disrepair since the Duke’s death. His loss had left the duchy in a precarious state: trade faltered, old alliances grew distant, and while the Duchess worked tirelessly to hold things together, her efforts were met with mounting difficulty. With cost-cutting curbing feasts and visitors growing scarce, the use of the main hall could only mean news of great importance.</p>

<p>A mysterious visitor awaited them. Aragol, a traveler from a distant land called Barovia, had come bearing both news and a dire request. Irina, the daughter of Barovia’s burgomaster, had taken ill under strange and troubling circumstances. Aragol claimed the burgomaster ruled a rich land—one he would gladly open to trade, with generous terms, should his daughter’s saviors succeed. For Eldemere, desperate for renewed prosperity, the opportunity was too great to ignore.</p>

<p>And Aragol himself seemed earnest, his plea directed toward heroes well-suited for such a task: a devout cleric, a noble paladin, a gifted druid, and a wizard of...<em>well a wizard</em>. Each blessed by Lathander, the Morninglord, and armed with magic enough to face the unknown.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, the party accepted Aragol’s request and set out upon the road to Barovia. Thus begins our tale chronicled through the eyes and journal of the cleric, Ket.</p>
