<b>Hoberm Bendlefigs</b>
<p>This cheerful halfling druid, barely taller than a child, wears a forest-green hood with mouse-like ears poking out playfully. His ruddy cheeks and bushy mustache give him an approachable, whimsical air. Clutching a wooden spear in one hand crafted from his late Rhino companion, he gently cradles a family of wide-eyed possums in the other, their fuzzy heads peeking out from his arms like trusted companions. Though the woods behind him are dark, Hoberm’s warm smile and vibrant eyes suggest a soul deeply rooted in the rhythms of nature, always ready to comfort, protect, and offer strange but sincere kindness even if it’s not always welcome.</p>

<b>Ket L. Bell</b>
<p>Bathed in the warm glow of a sunrise, this muscular cleric exudes radiant positivity and divine strength. His bronze-hued armor gleams with a golden sunburst across the chest, and a bright red cape billows behind him. With tousled hair, a chiseled jaw, and a confident smile, he looks like the physical embodiment of vitality and hope. He casually holds a blade that sheds sunlight and shows his commitment to Lathander. Ket's aura suggests both protector and Lathander's champion with the energy of a personal trainer who believes in your best self.</p>

<b>Rick Warmont</b>
<p>A young paladin clad in polished steel armor gazes ahead with quiet pride. A red cape drapes over his shoulders, framing a gleaming sunburst engraved on his breastplate—the unmistakable symbol of Lathander. His neatly cropped dark hair and clean, noble features hint at his upbringing in court, but there's an earnest determination behind his composed expression. He stands tall, family sword at the ready, as though posing for a formal portrait—but the weight of legacy and unspoken doubts lingers just behind his eyes.</p>

<b>Gadwick the Wizened</b>
<p>A gaunt, weathered wizard in a charcoal-gray cloak stands solemnly, pipe smoke curling around his stern face. His dark, intense eyes suggest a man who’s peered too long into forgotten tomes and painful memories of his beloved Fiona. A broad-brimmed, crooked hat casts a shadow over his face, amplifying his brooding presence. He clutches a thick, leather-bound book in one hand and a gnarled staff in the other, with potion and <em>other</em> flasks hanging from his belt he shows off tools of arcane power and a lifetime scarred by regret. His posture is stiff, like one who’s grown used to carrying the weight of loss and knowledge both.</p>
