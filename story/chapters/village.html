<p>Ismark gave us a bit more detail about the town and why it was in disrepair and the people seemed so despondent. Strahd, all roads and problems seemed to lead back to Strahd. And yet, Arrigal made no mention of him? Who is telling the truth?  Ismark does seem to respect and fear Strahd though, we were told not to say his name aloud because he has ears everywhere. An arch vampire who lives in a castle that overlooks the village. He's exceedingly powerful and Ismark is convinced Arrigal was tricking us to play Strahd's game. He promised he could prove it and implored us to follow him to his mansion.</p>
<p>Once we decided to follow Ismark, leaving the inn was precarious…As we decided to leave there was tension between Mirabell, the bar wench, and Ismark, she called him "one with a soul". Do not all beings have souls? We're taught so by Lathander. This was concerning that a soul should be viewed as a differentiating factor among the people here. I spoke to Ismark later and he said that half the children born in Barovia come into the world without tears, almost as though they had been robbed in the womb of their souls. The natural order of magic seems amiss here, the light of Lathander not creating the spark in new life? It sends a chill down my spine.</p>
<p>As for what happened next, I can't say I had or have a desire to return to the shabby inn or even stay beyond the time we had already spent there, but Gadwick did more than burn the bridge. I think he actually wanted to set fire to the inn and "do them a favor" after speaking rudely of the other patrons. Gadwick has a habit of speaking plainly and without the decorum I would. I hesitate to write it, but for the reader's reference, the privates of the woman offered to dance for us "crusty". It wasn't a fun exit by any means and something tells me the crossbow being leveled at us by the barkeep means we're not welcome to return.</p>
<p>Upon leaving, we crossed paths with a demon Ismark named Morgantha. She seemed sweet at first, noticing a few of our group and waving kindly, a smile on her lips. A delicious smell greeted us, something you would expect to find on a cool autumn night in a town back in Eldemere. It turned out they were pastries with a golden crust. She rapped on a door and was greeted by an exhausted man? Perhaps not the word, what would you call being tired beyond exhaustion? He opened the door to her and was elated to see her. That's when things changed.</p>
<p>The man bargained with Morgantha and they had a brief discussion before a number was agreed upon. I can't even remember what it was because what happened next turned my stomach. The price of these “dream” pastries is measured not in coins, but in children. She quickly knocked the terrified child out and threw him under the cart.</p>
<p>Disgusting, sad these people have been reduced to such a fate, nothing in their hearts. It took everything for me not to strike her, but a fight in the middle of the town an arch vampire's castle overlooks? We might as well have offered to play poker with our cards dealt face up. No, we must find out everything we can about Morgantha and the bone mill where Ismark says she conspires and makes her pastries and attempt to rescue the boy. This will help us answer what creatures does Strahd allow in his kingdom? I am certain only ones that he views as no threat to his rule. That Ismark hid from this woman either tells us something about his character or as he promised, more about the extensive powers of Morgantha and by extension Strahd.</p>
<p>Before arriving at the burgomeister's mansion, Ismark's home, he told of Mary a woman to whom he delivers food. According to him, she is quite mad unfortunately over the disappearance of her daughter. We chose to visit Mary with him, perhaps she can vouch for Ismark's character.</p>
<p>Hoberm rushed into Mary's home after smelling the mold emanating from it, later telling us it was a strain he finds irresistible. Hoberm often acts on instinct and lacks a bit of social restraint in a different way than Gadwick. My notes of their interaction comes from what he told us later. He said he tried kindness, but it backfired on him slightly. The woman was mad with grief, and was exhausted he believes and lashing out slightly. To soothe her Hoberm channeled some of the natural world around us and she briefly had some clarity. Hoberm confided magic felt off, wrong in this land. Something to note, but in a land where the sun doesn't seem to shine, how could nature feel right? Appreciative of Hoberm offering to seek out her daughter she gifted him a doll which I found sweet. That is, however, until we learned her daughter Gertruda was 25. What I first thought was a raggedy children’s toy turned into something grotesque, a token of madness. Just another item to add to the list I suppose.</p>
<p>With Mary sorted for the time being, we set off for the mansion and arrived with no more fanfare. Calling it a mansion was a bit generous, tattered as it were. Once clearly a noble home, it has been reduced to a shadow of its former glory, destitute. As we approached, a stranger opened the door, her thin armored silhouette framing the ruined doorway a stark contrast from the ragged mansion. "Ireena" Ismark called and you could hear the smile in his voice...</p>
